# TF2 - Free Guns!
Sourcemod plugin that allows any class to pick up any weapon on the ground.

To install, simply go to the Releases section and unpack the archive into your TF2 server installation.

This plugin requires [TF2 Econ Data](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFEconData).

Thank you to [Zabaniya001/TF2-ProperClassWeaponAnimations](https://github.com/Zabaniya001/TF2-ProperClassWeaponAnimations) and [rafradek/sigsegv-mvm](https://github.com/rafradek/sigsegv-mvm/) for their incredible work before me that I could build off of.

_*I am not, and do not claim to be, giving away free firearms. I am simply removing the restrictions on them. 
In other words, I am disabling Valve's gun control measures, and freeing TF2's firearms._
